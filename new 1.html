  <h1>The second day of my summer holiday</h1>
   <p>I was going to go to the movie theatre with my friends, to go for a walk. On the next day my grandma called me and said i need to go tothe village and help with cleaning. We were also going to visit my great-grandfather.
</p> The first trouble we had was traffic jams. There was an accident and we were on the road to 5 hours! It was boiling. It was awful.
</p>We arrived at the place, everything was great. I helped a lot? we sometimes went for a walks, ate ice cream. And we're going home soon, but the car broke down. But my grandfather fixed it and we went home.
</body> This is how the first two weeks of my last summer went.
